# wav2flac_sample_converter
 Automatic audio converter. From wav to flac, for all your directory and subdirectories content

Are you a music producer? 
Do you have too audio samples? 
Do you want to save hdd space? 

Well, this is the solution for you, motherf*cker!!!

You can use it as an exe file with Windows or as a script from python.

In order to use it as an executable, you have to move the wav2flac_converter.exe and ffmpeg.exe files to your samples folder, then you just need to run it and the program will do the hard work for you, while you're eating fat and crispy chips on your sofa...

If you prefer to mod the script or run it with python, well, just run it but first remember to download all the modules required: os, pydub, tqdm, shutil, and unidecode. 

PLEASE NOTE: if you run it with python, then you need also to have installed ffmpeg in your pc! Please install it with pip or conda, depending on your environment.

If you appreciate it, please let me know something :)
